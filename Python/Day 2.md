# Hello Computer!

In the previous lecture, we learned about what a programming language is. 

In this course, we will be focusing on the Python language as our means of communicating with the computer. 

Our goal is to learn how to communicate with the computer using Python effectively. 

In today's lecture, we will instruct the computer to display some text on the screen. It's important to understand that the computer doesn't comprehend Python directly; it can only understand the language of 0s and 1s. However, we have a translator that will convert our Python instructions into 0s and 1s.

Let's start by instructing the computer to print the text "Life is beautiful" on the screen. To achieve this, we will use the following code:

```
print("Life is beautiful")
```

Python provides us with a handy tool called the `print()` function. It informs us that whatever we include within the parentheses will be displayed on the screen. In Python, a string of text is always enclosed in double quotes.

For example:

```
print("This is some text")
```

By utilizing this function, we can instruct the computer to display the text enclosed in double quotes on the screen.

Please note that the provided code examples demonstrate the usage of the `print()` function to achieve our desired outcome.

## Homework

1. Open the online Python playground by visiting https://playground.programiz.com/.
2. Once the playground is loaded, locate the area where you can enter your Python code.
3. Inside the code area, type the following line of code:

```python
print("Hello, computer!")
```

4. Make sure to enclose the text you want to display within the double quotes.
5. After entering the code, execute it by pressing the "Run" or "Execute" button.
6. The computer will then display the text "Hello, computer!" on the screen.

By following these steps, you will be able to use the `print()` function to instruct the computer to display text on the screen. Remember to double-check that the text is correctly enclosed within double quotes for it to work properly.

Additionally, kindly take a screenshot of your first instructions to the computer and provide it to us. We wish you a delightful learning experience!
