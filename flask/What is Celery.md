Celery is an open-source project for implementing asynchronous task queues and job queues in Python applications [Source 1](https://colaninfotech.com/blog/what-is-celery-why-is-it-a-must-have-skill-for-python-developers/). It allows you to run time-consuming Python functions in the background, enabling your application to respond to user requests quickly while offloading long-running tasks onto the queue [Source 0](https://medium.com/scalereal/understanding-celery-part-1-why-use-celery-and-what-is-celery-b96bf958cd80).

Celery is particularly useful for web applications because it can help improve performance by running parts of the functionality as postponed tasks, either on the same server as other tasks or on a different server [Source 2](https://codeburst.io/the-celery-python-guide-basics-examples-and-useful-tips-d8da1fcfaea3). Common use cases for Celery in web applications include:

1. Sending emails: By using Celery to handle email sending, response times to customers can be reduced, as the sending process is separated from the main code responsible for returning the response [Source 2](https://codeburst.io/the-celery-python-guide-basics-examples-and-useful-tips-d8da1fcfaea3).
2. Connecting to third-party APIs: Celery can help manage connections to external APIs, allowing your application to continue processing other tasks while waiting for API responses [Source 4](https://nickjanetakis.com/blog/4-use-cases-for-when-to-use-celery-in-a-flask-application).
3. Performing long-running tasks: Tasks that take a long time to complete can be offloaded to Celery, improving overall application performance and responsiveness [Source 4](https://nickjanetakis.com/blog/4-use-cases-for-when-to-use-celery-in-a-flask-application).
4. Running tasks on a schedule: Celery can be used to execute tasks at specific intervals or times, allowing you to better plan your work progress [Source 2](https://codeburst.io/the-celery-python-guide-basics-examples-and-useful-tips-d8da1fcfaea3).

Celery provides additional benefits such as tracking failed tasks, setting up retry policies for failed tasks, rate-limiting tasks, and working with data chunks on long-running tasks [Source 2](https://codeburst.io/the-celery-python-guide-basics-examples-and-useful-tips-d8da1fcfaea3). It uses message brokers like RabbitMQ or Redis to keep track of the work sent to it, ensuring that your job queue remains intact even if your app server crashes [Source 4](https://nickjanetakis.com/blog/4-use-cases-for-when-to-use-celery-in-a-flask-application).

In summary, Celery is a powerful tool for handling asynchronous tasks in web applications, improving performance and responsiveness by offloading time-consuming tasks to the background. It offers various features that make it a must-have skill for Python developers [Source 1](https://colaninfotech.com/blog/what-is-celery-why-is-it-a-must-have-skill-for-python-developers/).
