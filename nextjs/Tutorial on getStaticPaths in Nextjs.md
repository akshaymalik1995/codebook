## Introduction

`getStaticPaths` is a function used in Next.js to pre-generate static pages for dynamic routes. It is used in combination with `getStaticProps` to statically pre-render pages that use dynamic routes. The function should be exported from the page that uses dynamic routes.

## When to use getStaticPaths

You should use `getStaticPaths` if:
- You are statically pre-rendering pages that use dynamic routes
- The page must be pre-rendered (for SEO) and be very fast.
- The data can be stored directly and is not client-specific.

## getStaticPaths function

The `getStaticPaths` function in Next.js is used to pre-generate static pages for dynamic routes. It is during the build process in production, and it will not be called during runtime.

The function returns an object with two properties:
- `paths` : an array of the dynamic parameters of the pre-generated static pages.
- `fallback` : a variable that controls the action when the user is trying to access a page whose dynamic parameter is not listed in the `paths` array. It has three values:
	-  `false`: The default value of the `fallback` property. If the request of the user is not listed in the `paths` array, Next.js will return a 404 page as the result.
	- `true`: Tells Next.js to generate the static version for the user's request on the fly.
	- `blocking` : This is similar to `fallback: true` in that it does not return a 404 page for paths that have not yet been generated. However, unlike `fallback: true`, there is no fallback page displayed to users. Instead, Next.js blocks or waits for the page to be generated before displaying anything to the user. Once the page has been generated, it will be cached, and all future visits will receive the generated page.

When using the `fallback: 'blocking'`, you do not need to check for `router.isFallback` in your component, as Next.js will wait for the page to be generated before sending a response to the user's browser.


## Example

Here is an example of how to use `getStaticPaths` with a dynamic route `/user/[userId].js`

```jsx
export async function getStaticPaths() {
	const users = await // fetch users data

	// Generate the paths
	const paths = users.map(user => ({
		params : { userId : user.id }
	}))

	return {
		paths, 
		fallback : true
	}

}
```

Here is an example of how to use `getStaticPaths` with `fallback: 'blocking'`

```js
export async function getStaticPaths() {

return {
	paths : [],
	fallback : "blocking"
}
}
```

## Handling Fallback

When using `fallback` set to `true`, you need to render a fallback component in your page component to avoid errors when trying to access data from props. You can render a fallback like this:

```jsx
import {useRouter} from 'next/router'
const router = useRouter()
if (router.isFallback) {
	return <div>loading...</div>
}
```

## Conclusion

`getStaticPaths` is a powerful function in Nex.js that allows you to pre-generate static pages for dynamic routes. It is used in combination with `getStaticProps` and is called during the build process. By properly configuring the `paths` and `fallback` properties, you can optimize your application's performance and SEO.
