Let's see what's so special about JavaScript, what we can achieve with it, and what other technologies play well with it.

## What is JavaScript?

JavaScript was initially created to "make web pages alive".

The programs in this language are called *scripts*. They can be written right in a web page's HTML and run automatically as the page loads.

Scripts are provided and executed as plain text. They do not need special preparation or compilation to run. 

In this aspect, JavaScript is very different from other another language called *Java*.

### Why is it called JavaScript?

When JavaScript was created, it initially had another name: "LiveScript". But Java was very popular at that time, so it was decided that positioning a new language as "younger brother" of Java would help.

But as it evolved, JavaScript became a fully independent language with its own specification called ECMAScript, and now it has no relation to Java at all.

Today, JavaScript can execute not only in the browser, but also on the server, or actually on any device that has a special program called *the JavaScript engine*.

The browser has an embedded engine sometimes called a "JavaScript virtual machine".

Different engines have different "codenames". For example:
- V8 - in Chrome, Opera and Edge.
- SpiderMonkey - in Firefox.
- ... There are other codenames like "Chakra" for IE, "JavaScriptCore", "Nitro" and "SquirrelFish" for Safari, etc

The terms above are good to remember because they are used in developer articles on the internet. We will use them too. For instance, if "a feature X is supported by V8", then it probably works in Chrome, Opera and Edge.

### How do engines work?

Engines are complicated. But the basics are easy.
1. The engine (embedded if it is a browser) reads ("parses") the script.
2. Then it converts ("compiles") the script to machine code.
3. And then the machine code runs, pretty fast.

The engine applies optimizations at each step of the process. It even watches the compiled script as it runs, analyzes the data that flows through it, and further optimizes the machine code based on that knowledge.

## What can in-browser JavaScript do?

Modern JavaScript is a "safe" programming language. It does not provide low-level access to memory or the CPU, because it was initially created for browsers which do not require it. 

JavaScript's capabilities greatly depend on the environment it is running in. For instance, Node.js supports functions that allows JavaScript to read/write arbitrary files, perform network requests, etc.

In-browser JavaScript can do everything related to to webpage manipulation, interaction with the user, and the webserver.

For instance, in-browser JavaScript is able to:
- Add new HTML to the page, change the existing content, modify styles.
- React to user actions, run on mouse clicks, pointer movements, key presses.
- Send requests over the network to remote servers, download and upload files (so-called AJAX and COMET technologies).
- Get and set cookies, ask questions to the visitor, show messages.
- Remember the data on the client-side ("local storage")

## What can't in-browser JavaScript do?

JavaScript's abilities in the browser are limited to protect the user's safety. The aim is to prevent an webpage from accessing private information or harming the user's data. 

Examples of such restrictions include:
- JavaScript on a webpage m
