JSON Server is a simple Node.js-based library that allows you to quickly set up a fake REST API for testing and prototyping. It's perfect when you want to work on the frontend of an application without having a real backend server ready.

Here's a step-by-step guide to get you started:

Step 1: Prerequisites Ensure you have Node.js installed on your machine. You can download and install Node.js from the official website: [https://nodejs.org/en/download/](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

Step 2: Install JSON Server Open a terminal or command prompt and install JSON Server globally using `npm` (Node Package Manager). Run the following command:

```bash
npm install -g json-server
```

Step 3: Create a JSON file Create a JSON file that will serve as the database for your JSON Server. For example, you can create a file named `db.json` with some initial data like this:

```json
{
  "posts": [
    { "id": 1, "title": "Post 1", "content": "This is the content of Post 1" },
    { "id": 2, "title": "Post 2", "content": "This is the content of Post 2" }
  ],
  "comments": [
    { "id": 1, "postId": 1, "text": "Comment 1 on Post 1" },
    { "id": 2, "postId": 1, "text": "Comment 2 on Post 1" }
  ]
}

```

Step 4: Start JSON Server
In the terminal, navigate to the directory where you created the `db.json` file. To start JSON Server, run the following command:

```bash
json-server --watch db.json
```

The `--watch` flag tells JSON Server to watch for changes in the `db.json` file and automatically update the API responses accordingly.

Step 5: Access the API JSON Server will now be running on `http://localhost:3000/`. You can access the API by sending HTTP requests to this address. For example:

- To get all posts: `GET http://localhost:3000/posts`
- To get a specific post with ID 1: `GET http://localhost:3000/posts/1`
- To add a new post: `POST http://localhost:3000/posts`

You can use tools like `curl`, Postman, or libraries in your frontend code (e.g., Axios) to interact with the JSON Server API.

Remember that this is a mock API for testing and development purposes, so the data won't persist between server restarts. For a production environment, you would need to set up a real backend server with a database.
