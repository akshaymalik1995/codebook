Welcome to a brand new tutorial series on algorithms with JavaScript! In this introductory video, we will provide an overview of the course and discuss the prerequisites to get started.

This course is designed for beginners to programming, software developers from non-computer science backgrounds, and front-end developers looking to excel in algorithm and data structure interview rounds.

Our approach to algorithms will be practical, focusing on problem-solving rather than delving deeply into theoretical aspects. Throughout the course, we will primarily use JavaScript as the programming language.

It's important to note that this course is the first half of a larger series. The second half will cover data structures in JavaScript and will be available in the future. Algorithms and data structures go hand in hand, and by completing both courses, you'll gain a comprehensive understanding of the subject.

Now, let's take a look at the topics we'll cover in this course:

1. What is an algorithm?
2. Measuring algorithm performance: time and space complexities
3. Introduction to Big O notation
4. Math algorithms
5. Sorting algorithms
6. Searching algorithms
7. Miscellaneous algorithms

By the end of this course, you will have a solid grasp of algorithm fundamentals and problem-solving techniques using JavaScript.

The only prerequisite for this course is familiarity with modern JavaScript. If you are new to JavaScript, I recommend watching my crash courses on JavaScript fundamentals, advanced topics, and important concepts in ES2015 and above.

I want to emphasize a few points before we proceed:

1. Learning algorithms and data structures may feel challenging and push you out of your comfort zone. Remember, it's normal to find it difficult at times.
2. If you struggle to understand a particular algorithm, I suggest grabbing a pen and paper. Try tracing the code execution with sample inputs; it's often a more effective learning method than staring at your monitor.
3. Take your time with the videos. Avoid rushing through the material.
4. The code used in the course will always be available in the description for reference.

With these points in mind, let's get started in the next video.
