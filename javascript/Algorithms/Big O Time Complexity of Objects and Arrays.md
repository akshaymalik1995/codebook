In this video, we'll quickly explore the Big O time complexity of objects, arrays, and their methods in JavaScript.

Let's begin with objects. An object is a collection of key-value pairs. When inserting or removing a property from an object, the time complexity is constant. It doesn't matter how many properties exist; it takes the same amount of time. Accessing a value given a key is also a constant time operation. However, searching for a value in an object has a linear time complexity. In the worst case, you may need to search through all the properties.

Now, let's discuss a few methods specific to objects. The `Object.keys()` method returns an array of all the keys in an object, `Object.values()` returns an array of all the values, and `Object.entries()` returns an array of key-value pairs. All of these methods have a linear time complexity.

Moving on to arrays, they are ordered and indexed starting from 0. When inserting or removing an element from the end of an array, the time complexity is constant. However, if you insert or remove from the beginning, the time complexity becomes linear. This is because the index has to be reset for every remaining element in the array.

Accessing an element in an array has constant time complexity, regardless of the index. Searching for an element in an array is still a linear time operation, as the element can be located at the last position.

Here is a list of common array methods and their time complexities:

- `push()` and `pop()` have constant time complexity.
- `shift()`, `unshift()`, `concat()`, `slice()`, and `splice()` have linear time complexity.
- `forEach()`, `map()`, `filter()`, and `reduce()` also have linear time complexity.

It's important to note that when solving a problem, if you use methods like `forEach()` or `filter()` along with a callback function that contains a for loop, the time complexity becomes quadratic. Interviewers may not be satisfied with this inefficiency.

With this understanding of the time complexity of objects, arrays, and their methods, we are now ready to start solving problems. In the next video, we'll begin with math algorithms.
