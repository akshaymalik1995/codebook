## Mean and median

Summary statistics are exactly what they sound like - they summarize many numbers in one statistic. For example, mean, median, minimum, maximum, and standard deviation are summary statistics. Calculating summary statistics allows you to get a better sense of your data, even if there's a lot of it.

## Summarizing dates

Summary statistics can also be calculated on date columns that have values with the data type `datetime64`. Some summary statistics — like mean — don't make a ton of sense on dates, but others are super helpful, for example, minimum and maximum, which allow you to see what time range your data covers.

## Efficient summaries

While pandas and NumPy have tons of functions, sometimes, you may need a different function to summarize your data.

The `.agg()` method allows you to apply your own custom functions to a DataFrame, as well as apply functions to more than one column of a DataFrame at once, making your aggregations super-efficient. For example,

```
df['column'].agg(function)
```

```py
# A custom IQR function
def iqr(column):
    return column.quantile(0.75) - column.quantile(0.25)

# Print IQR of the temperature_c column
print(sales["temperature_c"].agg(iqr))
```
