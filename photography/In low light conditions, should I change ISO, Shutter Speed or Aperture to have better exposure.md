In low light conditions, achieving proper exposure can be challenging. To compensate for the lack of light, you have a few options to adjust the camera settings:

1. Increase ISO: Increasing the ISO sensitivity allows the camera's sensor to become more responsive to light, resulting in a brighter exposure. You can raise the ISO to a higher value, such as ISO 800, 1600, or even higher, depending on your camera's capabilities and the level of available light. However, keep in mind that higher ISO settings may introduce more digital noise into the image, which can affect image quality.

2. Decrease Shutter Speed: Slowing down the shutter speed allows more time for light to reach the sensor, thus brightening the exposure. However, using slower shutter speeds can lead to motion blur if there is any camera shake or subject movement. To avoid this, it's important to stabilize the camera using a tripod, leaning against a stable surface, or employing image stabilization techniques. Use slower shutter speeds cautiously, and be mindful of the potential for blur.

3. Widen Aperture: Opening up the aperture (using a smaller f-number) allows more light to enter the camera, resulting in a brighter exposure. This is especially effective when using lenses with wider maximum apertures, such as f/1.8 or f/2.8. However, keep in mind that widening the aperture also affects the depth of field, resulting in a shallower focus area. Make sure to adjust the focus carefully to maintain sharpness on the subject's important features.

When dealing with low light conditions, it's often a combination of these adjustments that helps achieve the desired exposure. Start by increasing the ISO to a reasonable level, then adjust the aperture and shutter speed as needed. Consider the following tips:

- Begin with a wider aperture (smaller f-number) to allow more light, but be mindful of the depth of field.
- Use the slowest shutter speed that allows for a sharp image, considering both camera stability and subject movement.
- Increase the ISO gradually until you reach an acceptable exposure while balancing it with the desired image quality and noise levels.

Additionally, utilizing external lighting sources, such as a flash, continuous lighting, or reflectors, can significantly improve the lighting conditions and exposure in low light situations.

Experiment with different combinations of ISO, shutter speed, and aperture settings, and review your results to find the optimal balance of exposure and image quality for your specific low light conditions.
