In Go programming language, a channel is a communication mechanism that allows goroutines (lightweight threads of execution) to communicate with each other and synchronize their actions.

A channel is a typed conduit through which values can be sent and received. It is similar to a queue or a message broker, where messages are exchanged between different entities in a distributed system.

Channels can be created using the built-in `make` function, and are typed by the values they convey. For example, a channel of type `int` can only send and receive integers.

Here's an example of creating a channel of type `int`:

```go
ch := make(chan int)
```

Once a channel is created, values can be sent to the channel using the `<-` operator, and received from the channel using the same operator in the opposite direction. Here's an example of sending and receiving values from a channel:

```go
ch <- 42 // send a value to the channel
x := <-ch // receive a value from the channel
```

Channels can also be used to synchronize the execution of multiple goroutines. For example, a goroutine can wait for a value to be sent to a channel before continuing its execution. This can be done using the `select` statement, which allows a goroutine to wait on multiple channels simultaneously.
