In Go, you can serve static files such as CSS stylesheets using the `http.FileServer` and `http.Handle` functions provided by the `net/http` package.

Here's an example of how to serve a CSS stylesheet in Go:
1. Create a directory to store your static files (e.g. `static/`).
2. Move the CSS stylesheet file to the static directory.
3. Use the `http.FileServer` function to create a file server that serves files from the static directory. For example:

```go
fs := http.FileServer(http.Dir("static"))
```

4. Use the `http.Handle` function to register the file server with a URL prefix. For example:

```go
http.Handle("/static/", http.StripPrefix("/static/", fs))

```

This code maps requests to URLs that start with "/static/" to the file server, and strips the "/static/" prefix from the URLs before looking for files on the file system. This allows you to use relative URLs in your HTML files, such as `<link rel="stylesheet" href="/static/style.css">`.

When a client requests a file from the "/static/" URL prefix (e.g. `/static/style.css`), the `http.FileServer` function will look for the file in the `static/` directory and serve it to the client with the appropriate content type.
